title: "Cups-Filters"

<p>
CUPS is a standards-based, open source printing system developed by Apple Inc. for Mac OS® X and other UNIX®-like operating systems. CUPS uses the Internet Printing Protocol (“IPP”) and provides System V and Berkeley command-line interfaces, a web interface, and a C API to manage printers and print jobs. 
</p>
<p>
This project provides backends, filters, and other software that was once part of the core CUPS distribution but is no longer maintained by Apple Inc. In addition it contains additional filters and software developed independently of Apple, especially filters for the PDF-centric printing workflow introduced by OpenPrinting and a daemon to browse Bonjour broadcasts of remote CUPS printers to make these printers available locally and to provide backward compatibility to the old CUPS broadcasting and browsing of CUPS 1.5.x and older. 
</p>
<p>
From CUPS 1.6.0 on, this package is required for using printer drivers with CUPS under Linux. With CUPS 1.5.x and earlier this package can be used optionally to switch over to PDF-based printing.
