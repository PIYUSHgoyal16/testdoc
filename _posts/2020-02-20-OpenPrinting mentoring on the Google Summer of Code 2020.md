The Linux Foundation got accepted as a mentoring organization for the GSoC 2020 and OpenPrinting as one of its sub-organizations will offer a wide variety of student projects again.

This year our main subject is the Internet Printing Protocol (IPP). The students will implement the standards for driverless IPP scanning (driverless printing already works), IPP System Service (the printer setup tool of the future), Printer and Scanner Applications for providing drivers in the Snap Store, and more printing-related projects.

Each project consists of three months of coding from mid-May to mid-August. Students who want to participate, please see the [general GSoC info of the Linux Foundation](https://wiki.linuxfoundation.org/gsoc/google-summer-code-2020) and [our project idea list](https://wiki.linuxfoundation.org/gsoc/google-summer-code-2020-openprinting-projects). See also [Google's timeline](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/timeline).

Once you have found your preferred project idea(s) or you have your own idea, please contact the mentors mentioned in the idea listing or the organization admins as soon as possible. We will then introduce you to the work of OpenPrinting. Please do not wait for the start of Google's student application period.
