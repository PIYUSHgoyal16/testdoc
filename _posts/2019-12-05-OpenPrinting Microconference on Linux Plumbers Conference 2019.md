In September 2019, I have been on the [Linux Plumbers Conference 2019](https://linuxplumbersconf.org/event/4/) in Lisbon and held the first [OpenPrinting Microconference](https://linuxplumbersconf.org/event/4/sessions/52/#20190910) together with Aveek Basu and Rithvik Patibandia.

We presented our future plans in OpenPrinting work and discussed them with the audience.

The whole event got filmed by a professional video company and now finally all the recordings got edited and links to them posted on the Linux Plumbers web site. Go to the [page of our Microconference](https://linuxplumbersconf.org/event/4/sessions/52/#20190910) to find all the video links and also a summary of the event there.

If you prefer to lean back and watch the whole thing as a two-and-a-half-hour movie, go [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c_JaX4G7Zc).
